## üöÄ Project Story

This project originated as a real-time chat application for my Class 10th ICT course, serving as my first deep dive into backend development with **Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO**. To showcase my growth as a developer, I recently revisited this foundation to build a more advanced and intelligent platform.

The most significant enhancement is the integration of a powerful AI chatbot using **Google's Gemini API**, which responds to user queries that start with the `@bot` command. The entire user interface was also redesigned from scratch with a clean, responsive layout using modern CSS3, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

Additional features were implemented to create a more engaging chat environment, including real-time notifications for users joining or leaving and a private welcome message for new participants. The backend was also refactored for better security and maintainability, including the use of environment variables to protect the API key.

This evolution transforms a simple school project into a dynamic and interactive AI-powered application, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development, modern API integration, and user-focused design.
